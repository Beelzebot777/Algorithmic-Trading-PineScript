# **Bullish & Bearish Engulfing Detector Documentation**

## **Overview**
The **Bullish & Bearish Engulfing Detector** is a Pine Script indicator designed to identify and visualize **Bullish Engulfing** and **Bearish Engulfing** patterns on a TradingView chart. It applies criteria for **body size**, **volume**, and **trend analysis** to ensure the accurate detection of these powerful candlestick patterns.

This indicator also includes a **floating table** on the chart that tracks the total number of Bullish and Bearish Engulfing patterns detected during the current chart session. Users can customize the **lookback period** for trend validation, offering a more flexible approach to pattern detection.

## **Features**
- üìà **Engulfing Pattern Detection**: Identifies and labels Bullish & Bearish Engulfing patterns on the chart.
- üìã **Real-time Counting Table**: Displays the total number of Bullish and Bearish Engulfing patterns in a floating table.
- üé® **Customizable Lookback**: Allows users to customize the number of previous candles to check for a bullish or bearish trend.
- üî• **Volume Filter**: Ensures that only Engulfing patterns with increased volume are detected.
- üõ†Ô∏è **User Inputs**: Users can customize the lookback for trend detection and control the filtering logic.

## **How It Works**
### üî• **1. Pattern Detection**
The indicator identifies two specific types of patterns:

#### **Bullish Engulfing**
- The current candle is **bullish** (close > open).
- The previous candle is **bearish** (close < open).
- The current candle fully engulfs the body of the previous candle.
- **Volume** on the current candle is higher than the previous candle.
- A **downtrend** must be present before the Bullish Engulfing pattern (lookback period is customizable).

#### **Bearish Engulfing**
- The current candle is **bearish** (close < open).
- The previous candle is **bullish** (close > open).
- The current candle fully engulfs the body of the previous candle.
- **Volume** on the current candle is higher than the previous candle.
- An **uptrend** must be present before the Bearish Engulfing pattern (lookback period is customizable).

---

### üìã **2. Customizable Inputs**
Users can customize the indicator to adapt it to different market conditions. Key inputs include:

- **Trend Lookback**: Users specify how many candles to check for a prior uptrend or downtrend before identifying an Engulfing pattern.  
  **Default**: 3 candles (can be set from 1 to 10).  

---

### üìà **3. Volume Filter**
- The current candle must have higher volume than the previous candle to confirm a valid pattern.
- This ensures that the pattern is backed by sufficient market participation.

---

### üìã **4. Trend Verification**
- **Bullish Engulfing** requires a **downtrend** prior to the pattern.
- **Bearish Engulfing** requires an **uptrend** prior to the pattern.
- The number of candles to check for the trend is customizable.
- **Downtrend**: Consecutive closes are lower than the previous close.
- **Uptrend**: Consecutive closes are higher than the previous close.
