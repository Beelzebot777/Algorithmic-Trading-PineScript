### **2. Pattern Logic**
The script identifies two specific candlestick reversal patterns: **Morning Star** (bullish reversal) and **Evening Star** (bearish reversal).

#### **Morning Star**
A **Morning Star** is a bullish reversal pattern that occurs after a downtrend. It consists of **3 candles**:

1. **First Candle**: A large bearish candle.  
2. **Second Candle**: A small indecisive candle (can be a doji).  
3. **Third Candle**: A large bullish candle that closes above the midpoint of the first candle.  

**Logic**:
- The first candle must have a large bearish body.  
- The second candle must be small relative to the total range (indecision).  
- The third candle must have a large bullish body.  

#### **Evening Star**
An **Evening Star** is a bearish reversal pattern that occurs after an uptrend. It also consists of **3 candles**:

1. **First Candle**: A large bullish candle.  
2. **Second Candle**: A small indecisive candle (can be a doji).  
3. **Third Candle**: A large bearish candle that closes below the midpoint of the first candle.  

**Logic**:
- The first candle must have a large bullish body.  
- The second candle must be small relative to the total range (indecision).  
- The third candle must have a large bearish body.

### **3. Visual Indicators**
To provide clear visual feedback, the script uses **icons** and **background colors** to highlight the patterns on the chart.

#### **Icons**
- **Morning Star**: ‚òÄÔ∏è Icon displayed **below** the bar of the 3rd bullish candle.  
- **Evening Star**: üåô Icon displayed **above** the bar of the 3rd bearish candle.  

#### **Background Colors**
- **Morning Star**: The background of the 3 candles forming the pattern is filled with a **customizable green color**.  
- **Evening Star**: The background of the 3 candles forming the pattern is filled with a **customizable red color**.

### **4. Counting Table**
The script features a **dynamic table** displayed in the **bottom-right corner** of the chart. This table tracks and displays the **total number of Morning Star and Evening Star patterns** detected in real time.

**Table Layout**:
| **Pattern**    | **Count** |
|----------------|-----------|
| Morning Star   | Total Morning Stars detected. |
| Evening Star   | Total Evening Stars detected. |

The table updates dynamically as new patterns are identified in the chart.
